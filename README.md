# GO DRUMS!

I've lost quite some time of my life searching for a simple drum software for
playing MIDI drums, that works out of box and have no complicated interface
with buttons and useless features.

As I haven't found something good that worked cross-platform, I have been
trying to solve this issue writing my own, ready-to-go, full client-side
live drumming website: http://godrums.pw

This have been developed with an Alesis DM-6 drums, but should be extended to
support any MIDI device when it gains proper user interface.
